## How to use  
Installation should be pretty simple and straight forward so it will be excluded from this file to make it quick.  
Syntax:  
```  
import BioloJoke

# Get a random joke
# (returns a random joke):
BioloJoke.getJoke()

# Get a certain joke
# REQUIRES: passing int for joke number
BioloJoke.joke(number=PutAnIntegerHere)
```
